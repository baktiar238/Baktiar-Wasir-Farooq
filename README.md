## About

I am an undergraduate student of Physics at Kirori Mal College, University of Delhi (CGPA: 8.23/10).  
My research lies at the intersection of **neutrino oscillations, quantum information theory, CP violation, and mathematical physics**.

My work focuses on understanding how quantum correlations — particularly entanglement entropy — can serve as probes of fundamental particle physics and possible Planck-scale corrections. I am particularly interested in the deep structural relationship between particle mixing, quantum coherence, and information-theoretic measures.

I aspire to pursue a Ph.D. in theoretical high energy physics and contribute to the quantum foundations of particle phenomenology.

## Research

### Quantum Information Theoretic Approaches to Neutrino Oscillations  
**Bachelor Thesis Project**  
Collaboration with University of Salerno (Italy)

Supervisors:  
Prof. Massimo Blasone (External)  
Prof. Bipin Singh Koranga (Internal)

This work investigates neutrino flavor oscillations using quantum information measures.  
The project studies:

- Flavor-state entanglement structure  
- Density matrix formalism for mixed neutrino states  
- Von Neumann entropy evolution  
- Information-theoretic signatures of oscillation dynamics  
- CP-phase dependence in three-flavor systems  

The goal is to bridge particle mixing phenomena with quantum correlation theory.

### Modified Entanglement Patterns in Two-Flavor Neutrinos from Quantum-Gravity Interactions

This research explores quantum-gravity–motivated corrections to neutrino oscillations using entanglement entropy as a diagnostic tool.

Key aspects:

- Modified dispersion relations  
- Planck-scale suppressed corrections  
- Von Neumann entropy as quantum correlation measure  
- Statistical analysis over oscillation cycles  
- Entanglement sensitivity to fundamental-scale effects  

This work demonstrates how quantum information tools may act as probes of high-energy corrections in low-energy oscillation experiments.

### SEC Research Internship — CP Violation in Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiments  
Jawaharlal Nehru University (SEC Programme)

Supervisors:  
Prof. Bipin Singh Koranga  
Prof. Ng. K. Francis  

Worked on CP violation in three-flavour neutrino oscillations with focus on long-baseline experiments (295 km, 810 km, 1300 km).

Main components of the project:

- Exact computation of three-flavour oscillation probabilities in constant-density matter  
- Generation of bi-probability plots (Pμe vs P̄μe)  
- Numerical study of CP asymmetry  
  A_CP = (Pμe − P̄μe) / (Pμe + P̄μe)  
- Sensitivity analysis of δ_CP across different baselines  
- Python implementation of Hamiltonian-based evolution formalism  

The project connects geometric CP-trajectory representations with quantitative CP-odd observables relevant for long-baseline experiments.
